# Desgin-Patterns-in-VBA
This repository contains files that has been implemented to demonstrate Design Patterns in VBA

#OOP i.e. Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm is the least sought side of #VBA programming. With #OOP, I'm talking about programming using Class Modules. There are a lot of ways to explain Programming using Class Modules for Office Apps Automation and how it makes your job efficient and elegant as per maintainability and readability of the entire project.

With my people, we have started exploring Design Patterns and we've tried to implement some of the #designpatterns in VBA so we can explore how office projects can be enhanced by using world-known design patterns.

Design Patterns are nothing but proven strategies for programming! It's like if you want to serve good Italian food in your restaurant then you must have a specialized Italian chef in your kitchen who is at least the best in that area.

Similarly, when we design applications, to make them more maintainable, secured, and easy to update, we have to use one of many design patterns

Have a look. )
