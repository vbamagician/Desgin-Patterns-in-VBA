I have tried to implement Strategic Pattern in VBA and it was a nice attempt. Strategic Pattern is nothing but creating an object based on the behavior you want to set of the object. I have attached the file here which is nothing but an application called Travel Planner which creates a solution based on your selection. Whether you want to plan your travel using Bus, Train or AirPlane. Everything else has been calculated based on your selection. and it makes your code more secured and encapsulated.
